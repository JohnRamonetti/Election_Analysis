# Election Analysis

## Project Overview
We have been asked to perform an audit of the election results of a recent Colorado congressional election.  The goal is to see if we can use Python to automate this process in an efficient manner that can then be used on a much broader scale.  A Colorado Board of Elections employee has asked to include the following information in our election audit results.  
 1. The total number of votes cast
 2. A complete list of candidates who received votes
 3. The percentage of votes each candidate won
 4. The total number of votes each candidate won
 5. The winner of the election based on popular vote. 

A secondary/ followup task was added requesting that we include the following additional information in our analysis results.
 1. The voter turnout for each county
 2. The percentage of votes from each county, out of the total count
 3. The county with the highest turnout.
